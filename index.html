            <p>Since May 2022, Bangladesh has been hit with one of the worst floods in years, with millions in Sylhet
                and
                Sunamganj now homeless and without any belongings. </p>

            <p>More than 4.3 million people are impacted by the sudden flash flood and water congestion (WHO).
                Meanwhile,
                millions have been marooned, more than 9 million are homeless, and displaced women and girls are now
                particularly vulnerable whilst they shelter out in the open or in unfamiliar locations. Many communities
                also
                face the added challenge of a total lack of electricity, meaning they are then unable to keep in contact
                with
                family members and friends to ensure their safety.</p>
